# DrawingApp
App originally from @florinpop17 - I am using for learning, and may add my own tweaks and features from styling to functionality.


# Things I did different

1. stlying is different! - placement of buttons, color scheme

2. I made this function work in a different manner 

myself:
 ```
function updateSizeOnSpan() {
    sizeEl.innerHTML = ` ${size}`
}
```
orginal:
```
function updateSizeOnScreen() {
    sizeEl.innerText = size
}

```
